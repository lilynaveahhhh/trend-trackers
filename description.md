## UI/UX Design
Description:

Futuristic, glassmorphic dashboard.
Animated cooling effects (frost overlay, fan animation).
Clear feedback for every action (e.g., heat reduction, network switch).
Accessibility: color-coded warnings, readable fonts, responsive layout.


## Ethical Considerations
Safety: Process management only targets user-level apps, never system/critical processes.
Privacy: No data is sent externally; all monitoring is local.
Transparency: Users see exactly what is being optimized or killed.
User Control: All optimizations are user-triggered or require consent.


 ## Scalability
Modular backend: Easily extend to more metrics or optimization strategies.
Frontend supports new features via plug-and-play components.
Can be adapted for enterprise fleet management or IoT devices.
